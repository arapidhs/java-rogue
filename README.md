# Java Rogue
Java Rogue is a faithful and careful reimplementation of the classic **Rogue** game, originally written in C, now being ported to Java.
It uses the Lanterna library for terminal emulation, aiming for an authentic console-based experience.

The project is based on the released C source code of Rogue 5.4.4 available at:

Current Status:
This project is in an early development stage. Major systems like dungeon generation, gameplay mechanics, and UI rendering are actively being ported.
